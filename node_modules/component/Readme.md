# component

  Component package manager.

## Installation

   $ npm install -g component

## Installing packages

  To install one or more packages, simply pass their github
  repo names as arguments to `component install`. Dependencies
  are resolved and the component contents are downloaded into
  `./components` by default.

```
$ component install component/tip
  
   install : component/tip@master
       dep : component/emitter@master
   install : component/emitter@master
       dep : component/jquery@master
   install : component/jquery@master
     fetch : component/tip:index.js
     fetch : component/tip:tip.css
     fetch : component/tip:tip.html
     fetch : component/emitter:index.js
     fetch : component/jquery:index.js
  complete : component/emitter
  complete : component/jquery
  complete : component/tip
```

## Usage

 Via `--help`:

```
Usage: component <command> [options]

Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number

Commands:

  install <name ...>  install one or more components
  search [query]      search with the given query
  info [prop]         output json component information
  ls                  list installed components
```

## Features

  - no registry required, uses github repositories
  - fast (~2x faster than uncached npm at the time of comparison)
  - extensible sub-commands via `component-YOURCOMMAND` git-style
  - hackable internals (no monolithic lib here)
  - resolves dependencies

## Dependencies

  By using GitHub as the registry, `component(1)` is automatically
  available to you without further explicit knowledge or work
  creating a registry account etc.

  A nice side-effect of this namespaced world is that dependencies
  are explicit and self-documenting. No longer do you need to query
  the registry for a "repo" property that may not exist, it's simply
  build in to the package name, for example ["visionmedia/page.js"](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js) rather
  than the ambiguous "page".

## Developing component(1)

  `component(1)` and sub-commands are structured much like `git(1)`,
  in that sub-commands are simply separate executables. For example
  `$ component info pkg` and `$ component-info pkg` are equivalent.

  Because of this you'll likely want `PATH="./bin:$PATH"` in your
  profile or session while developing component, otherwise `./bin/component`
  will have a hard time finding the sub-commands.
